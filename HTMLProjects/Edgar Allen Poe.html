        <h3>A Brief History</h3>
        
        <p>
            Edgar Allan Poe, son of Actress Eliza Poe and Actor David Poe Jr., born 19th of January 1809, was mostly
            known for his poems and short tales and his literary criticism. He has been given credit for inventing the
            detective story and his psychological thrillers have been influences for many writers worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1827 Edgar published his first book, "Tamerlane and other poems" anonymously under the signature
            "A Bostonian". The poems were heavily influenced from Byron and showed of a youthful attitude.

        <h3>The Poe Museum</h3>

        <p>
            The Poe Museum provides a retreat into early nineteenth century Richmond where Edgar Allan Poe
            lived and worked. The museum features the life and career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his
            accomplishments with pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his many years in Richmond. Opened
            in 1922, in The Old Stone House, the museum is only blocks away from Poe's first Richmond home and
            his first place of employment, the Southern Literary Messenger.

        <center>
            <p>
                This maiden she lived with no other thought,<br />
                Than to love and be loved by me.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation of Beauty.<br />
                Its sole arbiter is Taste.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,<br />
                Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.
            </p>

            <p>
                The skies they were ashen and sober;<br />
                The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were withering and sere;<br />
                It was night in the lonesome October,<br />
                Of my most immemorial year.
            </p>
